# Overnight design-fidelity campaign — 2026-07-10

Page-by-page owner fidelity vs `design_handoff/source/*.jsx`. Dev-only, one PR per page,
squash-merged. Flat-chrome decision (CHANGELOG 7.23) supersedes handoff gradients.

## iCal (`ical.jsx` → `ical_sync_settings_screen.dart`) — SHIPPED

**Divergence found:** the sync-settings screen rendered a premium header
(`IcalSyncPremiumHeader`, audit/117 pattern, already matching the handoff top row)
**and** a second saturated hero card built with `rd.brandPrimaryGradient` +
`rd.purpleGlow` (`_buildHeroCard`). That was two competing headers plus a live
flat-chrome violation (retired purple gradient) — the handoff has no such gradient;
its status lives in a flat tinted `FeedCard` status row (`--bb-surface-variant` /
`--bb-error-tint`).

**Fix (UI layer only, no sync/token/export logic touched):**
- Flattened `_buildHeroCard` → a FLAT status card: tinted flat surface keyed to the
  aggregate feed status (`status.tint` @ 0.08 alpha, +0.24 hairline border), solid
  status-icon backplate (@ 0.16), status pill + secondary-text description. No
  gradient, no `purpleGlow`, no white-on-purple text.
- Removed the duplicate CTA: `Dodaj feed` now wired into the existing
  `IcalSyncPremiumHeader` via `onAddFeed: () => _showAddFeedDialog(context)`
  (header CTA was previously always null → never rendered). Single primary action.
- Named consts `_kHeroTintAlpha` / `_kHeroIconTintAlpha`; stale class + method
  docstrings updated (no longer claim a brand-primary gradient hero).

**Data honesty:** kept the dynamic status resolver (`_resolveHeroStatus`) — status/
description reflect real feed stats; no invented feed cards or benefit copy. The
handoff's static `SyncSettingsCard` (frequency / auto-block / email / daily-summary
toggles) was NOT added — those settings have no backing field in the model (would be
inventing UI).

**Verify:** `dart format .` clean; `flutter analyze` (screen) 0 issues; full
`flutter test` = **1673 passed** (golden harness green — screen not in golden set, no
re-bless). FROZEN untouched: `icalSync.ts`, `IcalRepository`, provider chain,
`syncIcalFeedNow` + capture-before-pop, keyboard-dismiss mixin, `PopScope`,
`_checkPlatformMismatch`. iOS plist untouched (prod).

**Live eyeball:** deferred — flat-chrome status-card pattern is already live-verified
on Pregled/Rezervacije (audit/126 §flatten); CanvasKit owner-auth eyeball not run.
