# Getting Started with Your Dashboard

Welcome to your new dashboard! This guide will walk you through the essential first steps to get your property listed and ready for bookings.

## 1. Create Your First Property

Before you can add any rental units, you need to create a "property." A property is a container for your units, like a hotel, an apartment building, or a vacation home.

1.  From the main dashboard, navigate to the "Properties" section.
2.  Click the **"Add New Property"** button.
3.  Fill in the required information, such as the property name, address, and contact details.
4.  Click **"Save"** to create the property.

## 2. Add a Rental Unit

A "unit" is the specific space that guests will book, such as an apartment, a room, or a cabin. You can add multiple units to a single property.

1.  After creating a property, you will be prompted to add your first unit. You can also add new units at any time from the property's page.
2.  Select the property you want to add the unit to.
3.  Fill in the unit's details, including its name, size, amenities, and photos.
4.  Click **"Save"** to add the unit.

## 3. Set Your Pricing

Once your unit is created, you need to set its pricing and availability.

1.  Navigate to the unit's page and select the **"Pricing"** tab.
2.  Here you can set the base price per night for any date.
3.  You can also create custom pricing rules for specific date ranges, such as weekends or holidays.
4.  Remember to save your changes.

## 4. Connect to Stripe

To accept online payments from guests, you need to connect your Stripe account.

1.  Go to the **"Settings"** page and select the **"Payments"** tab.
2.  Click the **"Connect with Stripe"** button.
3.  You will be redirected to Stripe to either create a new account or sign in to your existing one.
4.  Once connected, you will be able to accept credit card payments directly through the booking widget.

Congratulations! Your property is now set up and ready to receive bookings.
