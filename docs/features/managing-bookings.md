# Managing Your Bookings

This guide explains how to use the dashboard to view, manage, and track your bookings. There are two main views for managing your reservations: the **Timeline Calendar** and the **Bookings List**.

## 1. Timeline Calendar

The Timeline Calendar provides a visual, at-a-glance overview of all your bookings across all your rental units.

*   **Viewing Bookings**: Each colored block on the timeline represents a booking. The length of the block corresponds to the duration of the stay.
*   **Booking Status**: Bookings are color-coded based on their status:
    *   **Blue**: Confirmed
    *   **Yellow**: Pending (awaiting your approval or guest payment)
    *   **Gray**: Completed or Canceled
*   **Navigation**: You can easily navigate to different dates using the date selector at the top of the calendar.
*   **Viewing Details**: Click on any booking block to open a dialog with more details, including the guest's name, dates, and total price.

## 2. Bookings List

The Bookings List provides a more detailed, filterable view of all your past, present, and future reservations.

*   **Accessing the List**: Navigate to the "Bookings" tab from the main menu.
*   **Filtering**: You can filter your bookings by:
    *   **Date Range**: Find all bookings within a specific period.
    *   **Booking Status**: Show only "Confirmed," "Pending," "Canceled," or "Completed" bookings.
    *   **Unit**: View bookings for a specific rental unit.
*   **Viewing Details**: Click on any booking in the list to view its full details, including guest information, payment status, and any special requests.

## 3. Managing Individual Bookings

From the Bookings List, you can manage individual reservations:

*   **Approving or Rejecting Requests**: If a booking is "Pending," you will have the option to either **Approve** or **Reject** it. The guest will be notified automatically of your decision.
*   **Canceling a Booking**: If you need to cancel a confirmed booking, you can do so from the booking details page. Be sure to inform the guest of the cancellation. Please refer to your cancellation policy regarding refunds.

By using these tools, you can efficiently manage your reservations and keep track of your business.
