# Configuring the Booking Widget

The booking widget is a powerful tool that you can embed on your own website to accept direct bookings. This guide explains how to customize its settings to match your brand and policies.

To get started, navigate to your unit's settings page and select the **"Widget Configuration"** tab.

## 1. Basic Settings

This section covers the most common settings you'll want to configure.

*   **Appearance**:
    *   **Theme**: Choose between a light or dark theme for the widget.
    *   **Primary Color**: Select a primary color to match your brand. This color will be used for buttons and other key elements.

*   **Contact Information**:
    *   **Email & Phone**: Enter the contact email and phone number that guests can use to reach you with questions. This information will be displayed in the widget.

*   **Payment Options**:
    *   **Enable Stripe**: Allow guests to pay instantly and securely with a credit card. (You must have your Stripe account connected first.)
    *   **Enable Bank Transfer**: Allow guests to reserve now and pay later via bank transfer. You can add your bank account details and payment instructions in the space provided.

## 2. Advanced Settings

For more detailed control, you can configure advanced options.

*   **Booking Policies**:
    *   **Minimum Stay**: Set the minimum number of nights required for a booking.
    *   **Advance Booking**: Define how far in advance guests must book their stay.

*   **Custom Disclaimer**:
    *   You can add a custom disclaimer or message that will be displayed to guests before they confirm their booking. This is a great place to include important information about your property or local regulations.

## 3. Getting the Embed Code

Once you are happy with your configuration, you need to get the code to embed the widget on your website.

1.  Click the **"Get Embed Code"** button.
2.  A dialog will appear with a snippet of HTML code.
3.  Copy this code and paste it into the HTML of your website where you want the booking widget to appear.

Your booking widget is now live! Be sure to test it on your website to ensure it looks and works as expected.
