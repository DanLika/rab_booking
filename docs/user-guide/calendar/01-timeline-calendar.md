# Timeline Calendar Guide

The Timeline Calendar provides a visual overview of all your bookings across all your units. It's the best way to see your availability and occupancy at a glance.

## Navigating the Timeline

*   **View:** The timeline displays your units on the vertical axis and dates on the horizontal axis. Each booking is shown as a colored block.
*   **Date Navigation:** Use the arrow buttons or the date picker at the top to move forward and backward in time. You can jump to a specific month or year.
*   **Viewing Bookings:** Click on any booking block to see a summary of its details, such as the guest's name, dates, and status.

## Color Coding

The bookings on the timeline are color-coded by their status, making it easy to understand your schedule:

*   **Blue (Confirmed):** A confirmed and active booking.
*   **Yellow (Pending):** A new booking that is awaiting your approval.
*   **Red (Cancelled):** A cancelled booking.
*   **Green (Completed):** A booking where the guests have checked out.

💡 **Tip:** A legend is available on the calendar screen to remind you what each color means.

## External Bookings

Bookings imported from other platforms via [iCal Sync](./04-ical-import.md) may have a special indicator (e.g., an icon or a different pattern) to distinguish them from direct BookBed bookings.

## Filters and Search

You can use the filter and search options to quickly find specific bookings. You can filter by booking status, unit, or date range.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

For faster navigation on a desktop computer, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

*   **Left Arrow:** Move to the previous week/month.
*   **Right Arrow:** Move to the next week/month.
*   **"T":** Jump back to "Today".
