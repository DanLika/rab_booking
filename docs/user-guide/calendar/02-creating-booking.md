# Creating a Manual Booking

Sometimes you may need to add a booking manually, for example, if a guest books over the phone or in person.

1.  **Open the New Booking Dialog:** From the [Timeline Calendar](./01-timeline-calendar.md) or the "Bookings" screen, click the "New Booking" or "+" button.
2.  **Select the Unit:** Choose the unit the guest wants to book from the dropdown list.
3.  **Select the Dates:** Use the calendar to pick the check-in and check-out dates for the booking.
4.  **Enter Guest Information:**
    *   **Guest Name:** Enter the guest's full name.
    *   **Guest Email:** Enter a valid email address.
    *   **Guest Phone:** Enter a contact phone number.
5.  **Add Notes (Optional):** You can add any private notes about the booking, such as a special request from the guest or payment information.
6.  **Click "Create":** Review the details and click the "Create" button to add the booking to your calendar.

## Overlap Warnings

⚠️ **Warning:** If the dates you select overlap with an existing booking, the system will show you a warning. You will not be able to create the new booking until you resolve the conflict by changing the dates or the unit.

## When to Create a Manual Booking

*   For bookings made directly with you (phone, email, in-person).
*   To block out time for a non-guest stay (e.g., for a friend or family member) where you still want to record the "guest" information.
