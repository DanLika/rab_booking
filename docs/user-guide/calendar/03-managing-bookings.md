# Managing Your Bookings

The "Bookings" screen provides a comprehensive list of all your bookings. This is where you can view details, update statuses, and manage guest reservations.

## Bookings List View

When you navigate to the "Bookings" section, you'll see a list of your bookings, typically sorted with the most recent ones first. Each entry provides a summary, including the guest's name, the unit booked, the dates, and the current status.

## Filtering and Searching

To find specific bookings quickly, use the filtering options at the top of the page. You can filter by:
*   **Booking Status:** (e.g., Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled)
*   **Date Range:** (e.g., all bookings in the next month)
*   **Unit:** View bookings for a specific unit.
You can also use the search bar to find a booking by guest name or booking ID.

## Booking Statuses Explained

Understanding the booking lifecycle is key to managing your reservations effectively.

*   **Pending:** A new booking request that needs your attention. This usually applies to bookings made through the "Booking with Approval" widget mode.
*   **Confirmed:** A booking that you have approved and is scheduled to happen.
*   **Cancelled:** A booking that has been cancelled either by you or the guest.
*   **Completed:** A booking where the guest has successfully checked out.

## Managing Individual Bookings

From the bookings list, you can perform several actions on each booking:

*   **Approve a Pending Booking:** For new requests, you'll have an "Approve" button. Clicking this will confirm the booking and notify the guest.
*   **Cancel a Booking:** You can cancel a confirmed or pending booking. You may be asked to provide a reason for the cancellation.
*   **Complete a Booking:** After a guest checks out, you can mark the booking as "Completed" to move it to your historical records.
*   **View Details:** Click on any booking to open a detailed view with all the guest information, payment details, and any notes.
