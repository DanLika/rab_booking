# iCal Import: Syncing External Calendars

iCal is a universal calendar format that allows you to sync your BookBed calendar with other booking platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, or VRBO. By importing an iCal feed from another platform, you can automatically block off dates in BookBed when you receive a booking elsewhere, helping to prevent double bookings.

## What is an iCal URL?

An iCal URL is a unique web link to your calendar on another platform. BookBed uses this link to periodically check for new bookings and update your availability.

## Getting Your iCal URL

You will need to log in to your account on the other booking platform to find your iCal export URL. Here are general steps for common platforms:

*   **From Airbnb:**
    1.  Go to your Host Dashboard and select "Calendar".
    2.  Select the listing you want to sync.
    3.  Go to "Availability settings" and find the "Sync calendars" section.
    4.  Click "Export Calendar" and copy the URL provided.
*   **From Booking.com:**
    1.  Go to the "Calendar & Pricing" tab in your Extranet.
    2.  Select the room you want to sync.
    3.  Click on "Sync calendars".
    4.  Choose "Export calendar" and copy the URL.

## Adding the iCal Feed to BookBed

1.  **Navigate to iCal Settings:** In your BookBed dashboard, go to "Settings" and find the "iCal Sync" or "Connected Calendars" section.
2.  **Click "Add iCal Feed" or "Import Calendar".**
3.  **Paste the URL:** In the form that appears, give the calendar a name (e.g., "Airbnb - Beach House") and paste the iCal URL you copied from the other platform.
4.  **Save:** Click "Save" or "Sync".

## Sync Frequency

BookBed will automatically check the imported iCal feed for updates. This usually happens every few hours. Please be aware that the sync is not instantaneous.

⚠️ **Important:** There is a delay in iCal syncs (on all platforms). For last-minute bookings, it's always a good idea to manually block the dates on your other calendars to be safe.

## Viewing Imported Bookings

Bookings imported via iCal will appear on your [Timeline Calendar](./01-timeline-calendar.md), often with a special icon or color to show they are from an external source. These imported events will simply block the dates; you won't be able to see guest details for them within BookBed.
