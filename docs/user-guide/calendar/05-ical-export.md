# iCal Export: Syncing Your BookBed Calendar Elsewhere

Just as you can import calendars from other platforms, you can also export your BookBed calendar. This provides you with a unique iCal URL that you can add to other platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, or your personal Google Calendar. This ensures that when you receive a booking through BookBed, the dates are automatically blocked off on your other calendars.

## Generating Your BookBed iCal Export URL

1.  **Navigate to iCal Settings:** In your BookBed dashboard, go to the "Settings" > "iCal Sync" section.
2.  **Find the Export Link:** Go to the "Export" tab. You will find a unique iCal URL for each of your units.
3.  **Copy the URL:** Click the "Copy" button next to the URL for the unit you want to sync.

## Adding Your BookBed Calendar to Other Platforms

You will need to log in to your other accounts and find their "Import Calendar" or "Sync Calendar" feature.

*   **For Airbnb:**
    1.  Go to your Host Dashboard > "Calendar" and select your listing.
    2.  In "Availability settings", go to "Sync calendars".
    3.  Click "Import Calendar", paste the BookBed iCal URL, and give it a name (e.g., "BookBed Direct").
*   **For Booking.com:**
    1.  In your Extranet, go to "Calendar & Pricing" > "Sync calendars".
    2.  Click "Import calendar", paste the BookBed URL, and name the connection.
*   **For Google Calendar:**
    1.  Open Google Calendar on your desktop.
    2.  On the left, next to "Other calendars", click the "+" and select "From URL".
    3.  Paste the BookBed iCal URL and click "Add calendar".

## Keeping Calendars in Sync

By setting up both import and export iCal links between BookBed and other platforms, you create a two-way sync. This is the best way to reduce the chance of double bookings and keep your availability updated everywhere.

⚠️ **Remember:** iCal syncs are not instant. Always manually block dates for last-minute bookings if you need to be 100% sure.
