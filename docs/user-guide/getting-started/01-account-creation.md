# Account Creation

Creating a BookBed account is the first step to managing your properties and bookings. Here's how to do it:

1.  **Go to the registration page:** Open your web browser and navigate to [bookbed.io/register](https://bookbed.io/register).
2.  **Enter your details:**
    *   **First Name and Last Name:** Enter your full name.
    *   **Email Address:** Use a valid email address that you have access to. This will be used for verification and communication.
    *   **Phone Number (Optional):** You can add a phone number for easier contact.
3.  **Create a password:**
    *   Your password must meet the security requirements.
    *   💡 **Tip:** Use a strong, unique password for better security.
4.  **Confirm your password:** Re-enter the password to ensure it's correct.
5.  **Create your account:** Click the "Create Account" button.

After you create your account, we'll send a verification email to the address you provided.

## Common Issues

*   **"Email already in use" error:** This means an account with that email already exists. If you've forgotten your password, you can find instructions on how to [reset it here](../troubleshooting/01-common-problems.md#problem-i-forgot-my-password).
*   **Password requirements not met:** Make sure your password is long enough and contains the required characters.
