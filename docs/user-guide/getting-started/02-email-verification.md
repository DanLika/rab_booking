# Email Verification

After creating your account, you'll need to verify your email address. This is an important step to ensure your account is secure and that you receive important notifications from us.

1.  **Check your email inbox:** Look for an email from BookBed with the subject "Verify your email address".
2.  **Click the verification link:** Open the email and click the verification link or button inside. This will confirm that you own the email address.
3.  **Verification success:** Once you click the link, you'll be taken to a confirmation page. You can now log in to your account.

## Troubleshooting

*   **I didn't receive the email:**
    *   Check your spam or junk folder.
    *   Wait a few minutes, as it can sometimes take a short while to arrive.
    *   Make sure you entered the correct email address during registration.
*   **How to resend the verification email:** If you still can't find the email, you can request a new one from the login page or your account settings.

💡 **Tip:** Add our email address to your contacts to ensure you receive our emails in the future.
