# Bank Transfer Setup Guide

Offering bank transfer as a payment option provides a great alternative for guests who prefer not to use a credit card. When a guest chooses this option, they are given your bank details and instructions to complete the payment manually.

## 1. Adding Your Bank Account Details

Before you can offer bank transfers, you need to add your bank account information to BookBed.

1.  **Navigate to Bank Settings:** In your BookBed dashboard, go to **Settings > Bank Accounts** or a similar section.
2.  **Add a New Account:** Click "Add Bank Account".
3.  **Enter Your Details:** Fill in the required information carefully.
    *   **Account Holder Name:** The name on the account.
    *   **IBAN (International Bank Account Number):** Your full account number.
    *   **SWIFT / BIC:** Your bank's identifier code.
    *   💡 **Tip:** Double-check that all details are correct to avoid payment issues.

## 2. Enabling Bank Transfer on Your Widget

1.  **Go to the Unit Hub > Widget Settings** for the unit you want to configure.
2.  Ensure you are in **"Instant Booking"** or **"Booking with Approval"** mode.
3.  Under "Payment Methods", check the box for **"Allow Bank Transfer"**.

## 3. Customizing the Payment Instructions

You can control the instructions your guests see when they choose to pay by bank transfer.

*   **Payment Deadline:** Set a time limit for the guest to make the payment (e.g., "Payment must be received within 48 hours to confirm your booking"). If you don't receive the payment by then, you can cancel the booking.
*   **Custom Notes:** Add any extra information the guest might need, such as a specific reference number to include with their payment.
*   **QR Code Option:** If available, you can enable a QR code that makes it easier for guests to pay from their mobile banking app.

## How Guests Pay via Bank Transfer

1.  On your website's widget, the guest selects the "Bank Transfer" option at checkout.
2.  They will see your bank details and the instructions you wrote.
3.  The booking is created in your BookBed calendar with a **"Pending Payment"** status.
4.  The guest then needs to log in to their own bank and manually transfer the money to your account.
5.  Once you see the funds arrive in your bank account, you must manually update the booking status from "Pending" to **"Confirmed"** in BookBed.
