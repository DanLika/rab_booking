# General Payment Settings Guide

Beyond setting up specific payment methods like Stripe or bank transfers, you can configure general payment rules that apply to your booking widget. These settings give you more control over how and when you get paid.

You can find these options in the **Unit Hub > Widget Settings** tab.

## Deposit / Prepayment Percentage

You can choose to either collect the full payment upfront or just a deposit.
*   **100% (Full Payment):** The guest pays the entire booking amount at the time of booking.
*   **50% (Deposit):** The guest pays half of the total amount to confirm the booking. The remaining balance is typically paid closer to the check-in date or upon arrival.
*   **Custom Percentage:** Set any deposit percentage you prefer.

The remaining balance for deposit bookings will need to be collected manually.

## Pay on Arrival Option

Enabling the "Pay on Arrival" option allows guests to reserve their booking without paying anything online. They will pay you in person when they check in.
⚠️ **Warning:** This option is convenient for guests but carries a higher risk of no-shows. It's often best used in combination with a clear cancellation policy.

## Managing Multiple Payment Methods

If you enable multiple payment methods (e.g., Stripe, Bank Transfer, and Pay on Arrival), guests will be able to choose their preferred option at checkout. This flexibility can lead to more bookings.

## Payment Deadline

For non-instant payment methods like bank transfers, you can set a payment deadline. This is the amount of time a guest has to make the payment before their provisional booking is automatically cancelled. For example, "24 hours".

## Cancellation Policy

Clearly defining your cancellation policy is crucial. You can add text to the widget settings explaining your rules, such as:
*   "Free cancellation up to 14 days before arrival."
*   "50% of the total amount will be charged if cancelled within 7 days of arrival."
*   "Non-refundable."

## Refund Handling

Refunds are not processed through BookBed. If you need to refund a guest, you must do it through the platform where you received the payment.
*   **For Stripe payments:** Log in to your Stripe dashboard, find the payment, and issue a full or partial refund.
*   **For bank transfers:** You will need to manually transfer the money back to the guest's bank account.
