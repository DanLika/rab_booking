# Base Price Setup

The base price is the default price per night for your unit. This price will be used for any dates where you haven't set a custom price.

## How to Set the Base Price

1.  **Go to the Unit Hub:** Navigate to "Properties", select a property, and then choose the unit you want to edit.
2.  **Go to the Pricing Tab:** In the Unit Hub, click on the "Pricing" tab.
3.  **Enter the Base Price:** Find the "Base Price" field and enter your desired default price per night.
4.  **Set Your Currency:** Make sure the correct currency is selected for your property. This is usually set at the property level.
5.  **Save Changes:** Click the "Save" button to apply the new base price.

## When Does the Base Price Apply?

The base price is used as a fallback. If you set [custom daily prices](./02-custom-prices.md) for specific dates (like weekends or holidays), those prices will override the base price. For any dates without a custom price, the base price will be used.

💡 **Tip:** Set your base price to your standard off-season rate. You can then add higher custom prices for your busy seasons.
