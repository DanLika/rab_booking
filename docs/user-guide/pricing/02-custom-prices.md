## Pricing Strategy Tips

*   **Weekend Pricing:** Set higher prices for Fridays and Saturdays.
*   **Seasonal Pricing:** Increase prices during your high season and for local holidays.
*   **Last-Minute Deals:** Consider lowering prices for unbooked dates that are coming up soon to attract last-minute guests.

💡 **Tip:** The price calendar is color-coded to help you see your pricing strategy at a glance. For example, higher prices might be shown in a darker shade and lower prices in a lighter shade.
