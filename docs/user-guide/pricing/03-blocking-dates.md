# Blocking Dates

There are times when you'll need to make your unit unavailable for booking. This could be for maintenance, personal use, or if the unit has been booked through another channel that isn't synced with iCal.

## How to Block Dates

1.  **Go to the Pricing Tab:** Navigate to the price calendar in the Unit Hub for the desired unit.
2.  **Select Date(s):** Click on a single date or select a date range.
3.  **Choose a Blocking Option:** In the panel that appears, you will see options to block the selected dates.

## Types of Blocks

*   **Block Entire Day:** This makes the date completely unavailable. Guests cannot check in or check out on this day.
    *   **Use Case:** Perfect for repairs, cleaning days, or personal stays.
*   **Block Check-in Only:** This prevents guests from starting their booking on this date. Existing bookings can still check out.
    *   **Use Case:** Useful on a day when a guest is checking out, ensuring you have enough time to prepare the unit for the next arrival.
*   **Block Check-out Only:** This prevents guests from ending their booking on this date. New guests can still check in.
    *   **Use Case:** Helpful if you have a tight turnover and want to prevent guests from requesting a late checkout on a day a new guest is scheduled to arrive.

## Bulk Blocking and Unblocking

You can apply any of these blocking rules to a single day or a range of dates. To remove a block, simply select the blocked date(s) and click the "Unblock" or "Make Available" option.

⚠️ **Warning:** Blocking dates will prevent anyone from booking them through your BookBed widget, so be sure you want them to be unavailable.
