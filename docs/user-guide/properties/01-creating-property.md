# Creating a Property

Adding a property is the first step to setting up your listings on BookBed. A property can be a hotel, an apartment building, or any other type of accommodation with one or more units.

1.  **Navigate to the Properties section:** Click on "Properties" in the main navigation menu.
2.  **Click "Add Property":** Find and click the "Add Property" or "+" button.
3.  **Enter property details:**
    *   **Property Name:** Give your property a clear and descriptive name (e.g., "Seaside Villas").
    *   **Property Address:** Enter the full address of the property.
    *   **Property Description:** Write a short description to highlight the best features of your property.
4.  **Upload a property image (optional):** You can add a main image for your property. This can be an exterior shot or a photo of the main lobby.
    *   💡 **Tip:** Use a high-quality, attractive photo to make a good first impression.
5.  **Click "Save":** Once you've entered all the information, click the "Save" button.

Congratulations, you've created your first property! The next step is to [add units](./02-adding-units.md) to this property.
