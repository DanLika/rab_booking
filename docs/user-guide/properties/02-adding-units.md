# Adding Units

Once you've created a property, you need to add one or more units to it. A unit is an individual bookable space, such as a room, apartment, or villa.

1.  **Select your property:** From the "Properties" list, click on the property you want to add a unit to.
2.  **Click "Add Unit":** Inside the property view, find and click the "Add Unit" button.
3.  **Enter unit details:**
    *   **Unit Name:** Give the unit a specific name (e.g., "Room 101", "Sea View Apartment").
    *   **Base Price per Night:** Set the default price for one night's stay. You can set custom prices later.
    *   **Capacity (Guests):** Enter the maximum number of guests that can stay in the unit.
    *   **Unit Description:** Describe the unit's features, amenities, and what makes it unique.
4.  **Upload unit images:** Add several high-quality photos of the unit.
    *   💡 **Tip:** Include photos of the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen (if any), and any special features.
5.  **Click "Save":** After filling in the details, click "Save".

You can add multiple units to a single property. After creating a unit, you can configure its specific settings in the [Unit Hub](./03-unit-settings.md).
