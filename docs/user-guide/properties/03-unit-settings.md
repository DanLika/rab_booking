# Unit Settings (Unit Hub)

The Unit Hub is where you manage all the specific settings for an individual unit. Here you can control everything from pricing to how your booking widget appears on your website.

To access the Unit Hub, go to the "Properties" section, select a property, and then click on the unit you want to manage.

## Navigating the Unit Hub

The Unit Hub is organized into several tabs to make it easy to find the settings you need.

*   **Pricing Tab:** This is where you set your [base price, custom daily prices, and block dates](../pricing/01-base-price.md).
*   **Widget Settings Tab:** Configure the appearance and behavior of your [booking widget](../widget/02-widget-setup.md).
*   **Advanced Settings Tab:** Manage other settings related to the unit.

## Switching Between Units

If you have multiple units in one property, you can easily switch between them using the dropdown menu at the top of the Unit Hub screen.

## Saving Changes

⚠️ **Important:** After making any changes in the Unit Hub, make sure to click the "Save" or "Update" button to apply them. If you navigate away without saving, your changes will be lost.
