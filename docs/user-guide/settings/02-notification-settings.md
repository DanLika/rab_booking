# Notification Settings Guide

Stay informed about all the important activity in your account by customizing your notification settings. You can choose which alerts you receive and how you receive them.

To find these options, navigate to **Settings > Notification Settings** from your main dashboard.

## Notification Channels

You can typically receive notifications through two main channels:

*   **Email Notifications:** Alerts sent directly to your registered email address. These are great for summaries and non-urgent updates.
*   **Push Notifications (Mobile App):** If you use the BookBed mobile app, you can get instant alerts sent directly to your phone. This is the best way to stay on top of new bookings and urgent messages.

## Notification Categories

You have granular control over what you get notified about. You can typically enable or disable notifications for categories such as:

*   **New Booking Request:** When a guest submits a new booking for your approval.
*   **Booking Confirmed:** When a booking is instantly confirmed or when you approve a request.
*   **Booking Cancelled:** When a guest cancels their reservation.
*   **New Guest Message:** When a guest sends you a message.
*   **Payment Received:** An alert that a payment has been successfully processed.

## Quiet Hours

To avoid being disturbed at night, you can set up "Quiet Hours". During this time window (e.g., from 10:00 PM to 8:00 AM), non-critical push notifications will be silenced. You will still receive them, but your phone won't buzz or make a sound.

## Saving Your Preferences

After adjusting your settings, make sure to click the **"Save Changes"** button to apply your new preferences.

💡 **Recommended Settings:** We highly recommend keeping notifications for "New Booking Request" and "New Guest Message" enabled on at least one channel so you can respond to guests quickly.
