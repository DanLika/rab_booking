# Password & Security Guide

Keeping your BookBed account secure is essential to protect your data and your guests' information. Here’s how to manage your security settings.

You can find these options under **Settings > Security** or **Settings > Change Password**.

## Changing Your Password

It's a good practice to change your password periodically.

1.  **Enter Your Current Password:** For security, you'll need to confirm your existing password.
2.  **Enter Your New Password:** Choose a strong, new password.
    *   **Password Requirements:** Your password must meet certain criteria, such as being a minimum length and including a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
3.  **Confirm Your New Password:** Re-enter the new password to ensure it's correct.
4.  **Save:** Click "Change Password".

If you have forgotten your current password, you will need to log out and use the "Forgot Password?" link on the login page.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

If available, we highly recommend enabling Two-Factor Authentication. 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to provide a second piece of information (like a code from your phone) in addition to your password when you log in.

## Managing Your Active Sessions

In the security settings, you may see a list of all the devices and browsers that are currently logged in to your account.

*   **Log Out of a Single Device:** If you see a device you don't recognize, you can log it out individually.
*   **Log Out All Devices:** If you think your account may have been compromised, or if you just want a fresh start, you can use the "Log Out Everywhere" or "Log Out All Devices" button. This will log you out on all computers and mobile apps, except for the one you are currently using.

## Account Security Tips

*   ✅ Use a unique and strong password for your BookBed account.
*   ✅ Be cautious of phishing emails. BookBed will never ask you for your password via email.
*   ✅ Always log out of your account when using a public or shared computer.
