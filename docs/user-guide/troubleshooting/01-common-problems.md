# Common Problems & Solutions

Here are solutions to some of the most common issues you might encounter.

---

### **Problem: I can't log in.**

*   **Solution:** Double-check that you are using the correct email address and password. Passwords are case-sensitive. If you're sure the details are correct, try resetting your password.

---

### **Problem: I forgot my password.**

*   **Solution:** On the login page, click the "Forgot Password?" link. Enter your email address, and we'll send you instructions on how to set a new one.

### **Problem: I'm not receiving emails from BookBed (like password resets or notifications).**

*   **Solution:**
    1.  Check your spam or junk mail folder.
    2.  Add `info@bookbed.io` (or our official email address) to your email contacts to ensure our messages are trusted.
    3.  Verify that your email address is correct in your [Profile Settings](../settings/01-profile-settings.md).

### **Problem: The booking widget is not appearing on my website.**

*   **Solution:**
    1.  Make sure you have correctly copied and pasted the entire HTML embed code from the [Widget Settings](../widget/03-embedding-widget.md).
    2.  If you are using a website builder like WordPress or Wix, ensure you have pasted the code into an "HTML block" or the "Text/Code" editor, not the visual editor.
    3.  Clear your website's cache, as it might be showing an old version of the page.

### **Problem: My bookings from Airbnb/Booking.com are not syncing.**

*   **Solution:**
    1.  Remember that iCal syncs are not instant and can take a few hours to update.
    2.  Double-check that the iCal URL you imported into BookBed is still valid. Sometimes these links can change.
    3.  Go to your iCal settings in BookBed and trigger a manual refresh if that option is available.

### **Problem: A guest is having trouble making a payment.**

*   **Solution:**
    1.  Ask the guest to try a different credit card or payment method if possible.
    2.  If using Stripe, log in to your Stripe dashboard to see if there is any information about a failed payment. The issue may be with their bank.
    3.  If all else fails, you can create a [manual booking](../calendar/02-creating-booking.md) for the guest and arrange for an alternative payment method.
