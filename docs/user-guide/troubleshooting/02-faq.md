### **7. What payment methods are supported for guests?**

*   You can choose to offer payments via credit/debit card (through [Stripe](../payments/01-stripe-setup.md)), [bank transfer](../payments/02-bank-transfer.md), or allow guests to [pay on arrival](../payments/03-payment-settings.md).

---

### **8. How does the iCal sync work?**

*   iCal sync allows you to connect your BookBed calendar with other platforms like Airbnb or Booking.com. It works by sharing a special link between the calendars. When a booking is made on one platform, the other platform will see it and block the dates. This process can take a few hours to update. See our guides for [iCal Import](../calendar/04-ical-import.md) and [iCal Export](../calendar/05-ical-export.md).
