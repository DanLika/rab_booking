# Widget Setup Guide

Configuring your widget is a crucial step to ensure it works exactly how you want on your website. All widget settings are managed from the Unit Hub.

1.  **Go to the Unit Hub:** Navigate to "Properties", select a property, and then choose the unit whose widget you want to configure.
2.  **Go to the Widget Settings Tab:** In the Unit Hub, click on the "Widget Settings" tab.

## Key Configuration Steps

### 1. Select Widget Mode
This is the most important setting. Choose one of the three modes described in the [Widget Overview](./01-widget-overview.md):
*   **Calendar Only:** Just shows availability.
*   **Booking with Approval:** Guests request to book.
*   **Instant Booking:** Guests book and pay immediately.

### 2. Configure Payment Methods (for Instant Booking)
If you chose "Instant Booking", you need to specify how guests can pay.
*   **Stripe:** Enable credit card payments by connecting your [Stripe account](../payments/01-stripe-setup.md).
*   **Bank Transfer:** Allow guests to pay via [bank transfer](../payments/02-bank-transfer.md).
*   **Pay on Arrival:** Give guests the option to pay in person when they arrive.

### 3. Set Booking Behavior
*   **Minimum Stay:** Set the minimum number of nights a guest can book.
*   **Advance Booking:** Define how far in advance a guest must book (e.g., at least 2 days before arrival).

### 4. Configure Contact Options (for Calendar Only)
If you chose "Calendar Only" mode, you can customize the message that is displayed, such as "Please call or email us to book," and provide your contact information.

### 5. Save and Preview
*   **Save Settings:** Once you've configured everything, click "Save".
*   **Preview Widget:** Use the "Preview" button to see how your widget will look and behave with the current settings. This is a great way to test the booking flow before you embed it on your site.

💡 **Tip:** Configure the settings for one unit first. Once you're happy with it, you can apply similar settings to your other units.
