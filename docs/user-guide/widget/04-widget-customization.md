# Widget Customization Guide

Beyond the core functionality, you can customize the look and feel of your booking widget to better match your brand and provide important information to your guests. These settings are found in the **Widget Settings** tab within the Unit Hub.

## Appearance Options

You can adjust the colors of the widget to align with your website's design.
*   **Primary Color:** Change the color of buttons and important highlights.
*   **Background Color:** Set a custom background color for the widget.

💡 **Tip:** Use a color picker tool to find the exact hex code of the colors used on your website for a seamless look.

## Language Settings

You can select the default language for your widget. If a guest's browser is set to a different supported language, the widget may automatically display in their language, but you can set the default for everyone else.

## Information Display

You have control over what information is shown to the guest during the booking process.

*   **Contact Information:** Choose whether to display your phone number or email address directly in the widget.
*   **Payment Method Display:** If you offer multiple payment options (e.g., Stripe and Bank Transfer), you can customize how they are presented.
*   **Terms and Conditions:** Add a link to your booking terms and conditions. Guests will be required to check a box to agree to them before they can complete a booking.
*   **Tax/Legal Disclaimer:** Add a section for any required legal text, such as local tourist tax information or other disclaimers.

## Before and After Examples

Customizing these options can significantly change the guest's experience.

*   **Before:** A generic widget with default blue colors and minimal text.
*   **After:** A widget that uses your brand's colors, displays your terms and conditions, and is in your local language.

Always use the **"Preview"** button after making changes to see how they will look before you save them.
