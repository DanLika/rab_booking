# Flutter Tests

This directory contains the automated tests for the BookBed Flutter application, covering both the Owner Dashboard and the Booking Widget.

The tests are written using the standard Flutter testing framework (`flutter_test`) and are organized to mirror the structure of the `lib/` directory.

## Running Tests

To run all tests, execute the following command from the repository root:

```bash
flutter test
```

For more detailed instructions, including how to generate coverage reports and run tests for specific files, please refer to the main automated testing guide for the project.
